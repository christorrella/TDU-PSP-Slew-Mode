# Slew Mode for Test Drive Unlimited PSP

Slew Mode allows the player to move their vehicle almost anywhere on the map, from the tops of high-rise buildings in Waikiki to the Secret Island off the coast of Makapu'u.

# Compatibility

Currently this cheat is only compatible with the USA region version of the game (ULUS10249). If there's enough requests from the community to port it to other regions, I may do so.

# Installation

1. Copy the ULUS10249.ini file into the "Cheats" directory for PPSSPP (or copy its contents into an existing ULUS10249.ini file)
2. Enable Cheats in PPSSPP's System Settings
3. Enable the cheat in the PPSSPP pause menu under "Cheats" while the game is running

# In-Game Usage

## Pulling Up the Menu

The Slew Mode menu can be accessed at any point while driving on the map by pressing Right on the D-Pad. 

Slew Mode options can be selected by cycling through the Slew Mode menu with subsequent presses of Right on the D-Pad.

Note that this cheat hijacks the existing Driving Mode/TCS (Traction Control System) menu, allowing for easy usage of Slew Mode from within the game. Because of this, TCS is effectively locked in a "disabled" state until the cheat is disabled from PPSSPP's Cheats pause menu and the game is re-loaded.

## Menu Options
The Slew Mode menu cycles through three different modes: 'Speed 5', 'Speed 1', and 'Disable'.

'Speed 5' and 'Speed 1' enable Slew Mode and allow the vehicle to move around the map coordinate system at a speed scale of 5x or 1x, respectively. 

5x is useful for moving the vehicle quickly to traverse vast distances like large bodies of water, while 1x is useful for precisely positioning the vehicle, such as on the roof of a building. 

'Disable' turns off Slew Mode and re-instroduces normal physics, allowing the vehicle to drive again freely.

## Moving the Vehicle

* When Slew Mode is enabled (with 'Speed 5' or 'Speed 1'), the vehicle auto-locks to face South on the map.
* Make the vehicle ascend and descend with Circle and Square, respectively.
* Move the vehicle in any of the cardinal directions by moving the Left Analog Stick. (You may need to ascend first.)
* Set Slew Mode to 'Disable' from within the Slew Mode menu to enable normal physics and move the vehicle freely again.

# Known Bugs
* Sometimes Slew Mode may inadvertently "capture" an NPC vehicle, also moving it in the same fashion as the player's vehicle.
* Vehicle collision with the ground is capable of being bypassed by descending rapidly with 'Speed 5'

# Why?
Getting access to the little islets that are scattered around the eastern part of the map is impossible without this cheat; most notably of which is the Secret Island off the coast of Makapu'u. 

The PC and Xbox versions of the game allowed you to teleport there, but the PlayStation vesions left that out. As a kid I fixated on trying to find a way to get there. 

Years later, with a degree in Computer Science under my belt, I decided to make a cheat that allowed me to itch this scratch I always had.

# Dedication
This cheat is dedicated to my late Father who bought me Test Drive Unlimited when I was a kid. (Love you, Dad.)
